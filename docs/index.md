# Introduction


## What is QuickForm?

QuickForm is a blazor component which allows you to create **downright gorgeous** HTML forms
with **minimal** effort. The simplicity of the component does not sacrifice customization!

## Who is QuickForm for?

**QuickForm is for Developers who value their time!** 
those who do not wish to spend their precious hours writing boilerplate forms.

I created this library to solve my own problems, to save my own time.
But over the months, it quickly grew into a passionate project which I believe will save a lot of dev-hours for a lot of people.
